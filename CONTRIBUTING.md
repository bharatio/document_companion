## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document_companion.git
   cd document_companion
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalusername/document_companion.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
# or
git checkout -b docs/your-documentation-update
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with the main branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
```

## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Style Guide

- Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) style guide
- Use `dart format` before committing
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all Dart files
flutter format .

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
```

### Architecture Guidelines

- **BLoC Pattern**: Use BLoC for state management
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI, business logic, and data layers separate
- **Models**: Use immutable models where possible
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors appropriately
- **Null Safety**: Use null safety features properly

### File Organization

- Group related files in modules
- Keep views, models, and business logic separate
- Use meaningful file and folder names

### Code Comments

- Write clear, concise comments
- Document public APIs
- Explain "why" not "what" in complex logic

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
