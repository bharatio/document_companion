# Development Roadmap

> **Document Companion** — Open-source document scanner & manager built with Flutter.
> MIT Licensed. Contributions welcome.

---

## Current State (v1.0.0)

### What works

- Camera capture and manual crop with 4-corner drag handles
- Folder management with tags, search, sort, date filters
- Image management — save to folders, grid/list view, viewer with zoom
- PDF tools — create from images, merge, split, compress, import, PDF-to-Word
- Batch operations — multi-select, batch delete/move/convert
- Recent documents tracking
- Dark mode, Material 3 theming
- Google Mobile Ads integration

### What doesn't work (despite UI/docs claiming otherwise)

- **Edge detection** — `MethodChannel` calls `findContourPhoto` but no native code exists on Android or iOS. Returns `null` every time. Users always get default crop corners.
- **Perspective correction** — `adjustingPerspective` also has no native handler. Falls back to rectangular bounding-box crop (no actual perspective warp).
- **Image filters** — `applyFilter` native call fails. Falls back to Dart isolate, but "Gray" and "Eco" filters are both identical (`img.grayscale`).
- **Auto-capture** — Not implemented.
- **Real-time contour overlay** — Not implemented. Camera shows raw feed only.
- **OCR** — UI labels exist, no implementation.
- **Tests** — Single placeholder test that tests a counter app, not this app.

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Bug Fixes & Technical Debt

> Fix what's broken before building new things.
> **Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-0`, `bug`, `good-first-issue`, `technical-debt`

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 0.1 | **Fix `deleteCurrentImage()` missing WHERE clause** — Can delete all rows instead of one | Easy | `bug`, `critical`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.2 | **Fix `bool.fromEnvironment` misuse** in `CurrentImageDatabaseHandler` — Should be `== 'true'` string comparison | Easy | `bug`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.3 | **Add missing `await`** on `FolderTableHandler.insertFolder` | Easy | `bug`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.4 | **Fix `FolderBloc.updateFolder`** — `firstWhere` without `orElse` throws if folder not found | Easy | `bug`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.5 | **Dispose StreamControllers** in all custom BLoCs (`FolderBloc`, `ImageBloc`, `TagBloc`, `RecentDocumentsBloc`, `CurrentImageBloc`) | Easy | `bug`, `memory-leak` |
| 0.6 | **Rename database** from `"test.db"` to `"document_companion.db"` with migration | Easy | `technical-debt`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.7 | **Fix "Eco" filter** — Currently identical to "Gray". Implement actual eco filter (e.g., reduced contrast grayscale or light threshold) | Easy | `bug`, `scanner` |
| 0.8 | **Add `FolderModel.fromMap`** factory constructor — `toMap` exists but no deserialization | Easy | `technical-debt`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.9 | **Extract duplicate `_parseColor`** into shared `ColorUtils` — Duplicated in 4+ widgets | Easy | `technical-debt`, `good-first-issue` |
| 0.10 | **Fix `SaveImageBloc` force-unwrap** — `CustomKey.navigatorKey.currentContext!` can crash | Medium | `bug` |
| 0.11 | **Remove hardcoded ad unit IDs** — Move to a config/constants file, use test IDs in debug builds | Medium | `technical-debt`, `ads` |
| 0.12 | **Replace placeholder widget test** with actual tests for at least `FolderBloc` and `ImageBloc` | Medium | `testing` |
| 0.13 | **Unify state management** — Migrate custom stream-based BLoCs to `flutter_bloc` pattern (matching scanner module) or document why both exist | Hard | `technical-debt`, `architecture` |

**Exit criteria:** All critical bugs fixed, no data-loss risks, StreamControllers properly disposed.

### Phase 1 — Scanner Foundation

> Make edge detection and perspective correction actually work.
> **Estimated effort:** 2-4 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-1`, `scanner`, `enhancement`
> **Depends on:** Phase 0

This is the most impactful phase. The app's core promise (document scanning) currently doesn't deliver on edge detection or perspective correction.

#### Option A: Google ML Kit Document Scanner (Recommended)

The fastest path. Google's Document Scanner API handles edge detection, perspective correction, and image enhancement out of the box.

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1.1 | **Evaluate `google_mlkit_document_scanner`** — Test on Android (API 21+) and iOS, document limitations | Medium | `research`, `scanner` |
| 1.2 | **Integrate ML Kit Document Scanner** — Add dependency, implement native setup for both platforms | Medium | `scanner`, `feature` |
| 1.3 | **Connect ML Kit output to existing crop/edit flow** — Feed detected corners into `CropBloc`, feed corrected image into `EditBloc` | Medium | `scanner` |
| 1.4 | **Remove or gate broken MethodChannel calls** — Clean up `findContourPhoto`, `adjustingPerspective` native calls that do nothing | Easy | `scanner`, `cleanup` |
| 1.5 | **Test scanner end-to-end** — Verify: capture → detect edges → crop → perspective correct → filter → save | Medium | `scanner`, `testing` |

#### Option B: OpenCV via FFI (More control, more effort)

If ML Kit is too opinionated or doesn't support a target platform.

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 1.1b | **Add `opencv_dart` or implement native OpenCV** on Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) | Hard | `scanner`, `native` |
| 1.2b | **Implement `findContourPhoto`** natively — Canny edge detection → find contours → approximate polygon → return 4 corners | Hard | `scanner`, `native` |
| 1.3b | **Implement `adjustingPerspective`** natively — `getPerspectiveTransform` + `warpPerspective` | Hard | `scanner`, `native` |
| 1.4b | **Implement `applyFilter`** natively — Adaptive threshold, color enhancement, sharpen | Medium | `scanner`, `native` |
| 1.5b | **Test on both platforms** | Medium | `scanner`, `testing` |

**Exit criteria:** Taking a photo of a document on a table produces a properly cropped, perspective-corrected rectangular image.

### Phase 2 — Modern Scanner UX

> Real-time edge detection overlay and auto-capture — the features that differentiate a good scanner from a great one.
> **Estimated effort:** 4-6 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-2`, `scanner`, `enhancement`
> **Depends on:** Phase 1

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 2.1 | **Real-time camera frame processing** — Hook into `CameraController.startImageStream()`, process every Nth frame | Hard | `scanner`, `performance` |
| 2.2 | **Live contour overlay** — Draw detected document edges on camera preview using `CustomPainter`. Handle coordinate mapping between camera resolution and screen size | Hard | `scanner`, `ui` |
| 2.3 | **Contour stabilization** — Debounce/smooth the detected corners across frames to prevent jittering | Medium | `scanner` |
| 2.4 | **Auto-capture** — When contour is stable for ~1.5 seconds, auto-trigger capture. Show countdown/progress indicator. Haptic feedback on capture | Medium | `scanner`, `ux` |
| 2.5 | **Visual feedback** — Contour overlay color changes (red → yellow → green) as stability improves. Pulsing animation when ready to capture | Medium | `scanner`, `ui` |
| 2.6 | **Manual/Auto toggle** — Let users switch between manual tap and auto-capture modes | Easy | `scanner`, `ux` |
| 2.7 | **Flash improvements** — Auto-flash in low light, flash mode persistence across scans | Easy | `scanner`, `ux` |
| 2.8 | **Focus tap** — Tap-to-focus on camera preview | Easy | `scanner`, `ux` |
| 2.9 | **Grid overlay toggle** — Optional rule-of-thirds or document alignment grid | Easy | `scanner`, `ui` |

**Exit criteria:** Camera preview shows live document edges. When held steady over a document, it auto-captures, crops, and perspective-corrects without user tapping anything.

### Phase 3 — Advanced Filters & Image Enhancement

> Make scanned documents look professional.
> **Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-3`, `scanner`, `enhancement`
> **Depends on:** Phase 1 (Phase 2 is nice-to-have but not required)

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 3.1 | **Adaptive threshold B&W** — Clean black-and-white for text documents (not just grayscale) | Medium | `scanner`, `filters` |
| 3.2 | **Auto-enhance / Magic filter** — Auto-adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness for best readability | Medium | `scanner`, `filters` |
| 3.3 | **Shadow removal** — Normalize uneven lighting across the document | Hard | `scanner`, `filters` |
| 3.4 | **Sharpen filter** — Unsharp mask for crisp text | Easy | `scanner`, `filters`, `good-first-issue` |
| 3.5 | **Color document mode** — Enhanced color with white-balance correction | Medium | `scanner`, `filters` |
| 3.6 | **Filter preview thumbnails** — Show small previews of each filter effect before applying | Medium | `scanner`, `ui` |
| 3.7 | **Brightness/Contrast sliders** — Manual adjustment controls | Medium | `scanner`, `ui` |
| 3.8 | **Image rotation** — 90-degree rotation and free rotation | Easy | `scanner`, `good-first-issue` |

**Exit criteria:** At least 5 distinct, visually different filters. Auto-enhance produces clearly better output than the raw photo for text documents.

> Streamline the flow for scanning multi-page documents.
> **Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-4`, `scanner`, `ux`
> **Depends on:** Phase 1

| # | Task | Difficulty | Labels |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 4.1 | **Continuous scan flow** — After saving a page, auto-return to camera for next page (skip the "Done" detour) | Medium | `scanner`, `ux` |
| 4.2 | **Page thumbnail strip** — Scrollable thumbnail strip at bottom of camera screen showing all scanned pages in session | Medium | `scanner`, `ui` |
| 4.3 | **Page reordering** — Drag-and-drop to reorder pages in preview | Medium | `ux` |
| 4.4 | **Re-crop / re-edit pages** — Tap a page in preview to go back to crop or edit for that specific page | Medium | `scanner` |
| 4.5 | **Delete individual pages** from batch before saving | Easy | `ux`, `good-first-issue` |
| 4.6 | **Page count badge** — Clear indicator on camera screen showing "3 pages scanned" | Easy | `ui`, `good-first-issue` |
| 4.7 | **Batch apply filter** — Apply same filter to all pages at once | Easy | `scanner`, `ux` |

**Exit criteria:** Scanning a 10-page document is a smooth, uninterrupted flow. User can reorder, re-edit, or delete individual pages before saving.

> **Estimated effort:** 3-4 weeks
> **Labels:** `phase-5`, `ocr`, `ml`, `feature`
> **Depends on:** Phase 1
